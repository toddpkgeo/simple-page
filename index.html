      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Todd, and I have been maintaining the front and back end of a
        complex mapping application for years. It's an internal app for a Fiber
        <abbr title="Outside Plant">OSP</abbr> (telecom) design-build company.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most of my experience is with Typescript, PHP, Python, bash; React, Vue;
        Laravel, FastAPI; docker, Geoserver, Redis, PostggreSQL and PostGIS.
      </p>
      <p>It's also fun to keep things very simple.</p>
